# Day 7 - Quality control of sequencing data

quality control

importance for big data - sequencing has an error rate (incorrect base calls) and when we have huge data sets...

the first steps to data processing are qc

run fastqc/multiqc

run fastp

run fastqc/multiqc again

check for contaminants

what are the top contaminants
the way bbsketch works - we expect closely-related calls. you will see a lot of oak species pop up just because the genomes share similar regions with tanoak
